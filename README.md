## JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains small beginner-friendly JavaScript projects that I built to practice basic concepts like DOM manipulation, functions, event handling, and simple UI logic.
Each project is inside its own folder and can be opened directly in the browser.

## Projects Included
1. Tic Tac Toe

  A simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game built using:

   - HTML
   - CSS
   - JavaScript

   Features:

    - Interactive 3x3 grid
    - Player turn switching
    - Win detection
    - Draw match check
    - Basic UI

2. Wikipedia Search App

  A beginner-level search app that fetches results from Wikipedia using their public API.

  - Features:

    - Search bar
    - Fetch and display live Wikipedia search results
    - Clickable links to full Wikipedia pages
    - Error handling for empty or invalid searches
